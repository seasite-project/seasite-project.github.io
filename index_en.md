# Self-Adaptation of Time-step-based Simulation Techniques on Heterogeneous HPC Systems

## Project description

The research project SeASiTe has the purpose to thoroughly investigate
self-adaptation of time-step-based simulation codes on heterogeneous HPC
systems. The goal is the design and provision of a software toolset with which
the application programmer can enrich a time-step-based simulation code with
self-adaptation techniques. The approach comprises self-adaptation with
respect to relevant system and program parameters as well as possible program
transformations which may improve the performance of program execution. The
optimization of the program execution for more than one non-functional
objective (e.g. execution time and energy consumption) is based on a
performance model which helps to reduce the search space for a more efficient
program version. Application independent methods and strategies for
self-adaptation are planned to be encapsulated in a software component called
Autotuning Navigator.
